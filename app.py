        Ever wondered what your bookshelf says about you? Upload a photo of your books and discover insights about your personality through the lens of Jungian psychology!

## How It Works
1. **Snap a Photo** - Take a clear picture of your bookshelf
2. **Get Your Reading** - Our AI analyzes your book collection and reveals personality insights
3. **Discover New Books** - Receive personalized book recommendations tailored to your unique psychological profile

## The Psychology Behind It
This app draws inspiration from Carl Jung's theories about personality types and psychological preferences. By examining the genres, authors, and themes in your collection, we create a fun personality profile that reflects your reading preferences and interests.

## Important Note
This is purely for entertainment! While based on established psychological concepts, this app is designed for fun exploration and book discovery - not as professional psychological assessment or medical advice.

## Support Local Bookstores üìö
Book recommendations include links to Bookshop.org, where your purchases support local independent bookstores and libraries. As a transparency note: I earn a small commission on purchases made through these links.
